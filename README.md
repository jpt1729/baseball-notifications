# Baseball Notifications

This is an application that tracks when the Phillies and the Astros play. When they play it sends notifications about each team scoring.

This was made to watch the Phillies and hate watch the Astros.

To use this,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpt1729/baseball-notifications.git
cd baseball-notifications
npm i
npm start
```

The goal of this is to connect to a speaker and it shouts something everytime a team scores!
